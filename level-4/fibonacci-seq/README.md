# Fibonacci sequence

Write a function that computes the sequence of the first n [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), with the following type:
```
val fib : int -> int list = <fun>
```

For instance, computing the first 10 elements of the sequence gives:
```ocaml
fib 10 ;;
- : int list = [0; 1; 1; 2; 3; 5; 8; 13; 21; 34]
```
