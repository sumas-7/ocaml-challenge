```ocaml
int_of_bitstring : bitstring -> int
```
converts a bitstring (interpreted as a number in base 2) into an integer.

```ocaml
succ : bitstring -> bitstring
```
computes the successor of a bitstring (interpreted as a number in base 2).

```ocaml
add : bitstring -> bitstring -> bitstring
```
computes the sum of two bitstrings (assuming they have the same length).
