# Logical Xor

Write a function of type:
```ocaml
xor : bool -> bool -> bool
```
that implements the logical connective [xor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) ("exclusive or").

Try with different implementation styles, using:
- the built-in logical connectives `not`, `&&`, `||`;
- conditional expressions;
- pattern matching.
